        "question": "Share your essay about Ada Lovelace",
        "answer": "As technology grows in popularity and power, some find it important to break down the history of technology, specifically computers, to deepen their knowledge in a concept that plays a huge part in their everyday lives. A question that commonly pops up when one escalates their knowledge on technology is whether Ada Lovelace is the first computer programmer. There is a percentage of people who believe that Ada doesn\u2019t qualify to have such a title due to reasons surrounding the engine she dedicated her life to not being regarded as a computer, or that her contribution to the analytical machine didn\u2019t deem her a programmer. Despite these arguments, there is a plethora of evidence that deems the analytical engine a computer, that her contributions to the analytical engine fall under the definition of a programmer, and that modern-day programmers utilize Ada\u2019s concepts, solidifying the claim that Ada Lovelace is the first computer programmer. The analytical engine falls under all seven definitions of a computer by John Spacey, but for length purposes, the fourth definition will solely be used: 'Programmable machines for storing, processing, and calculating data.' In a report on Babbage\u2019s Difference Engine, it contains a passage speaking of the function of the analytical engine: The primary movement of calculating engines is the discontinuous train, of which one form is sketched in the accompanying diagram (fig.1): -B is the follower, an ordinary spur wheel with (say) 10 teeth; A is its driver, and this has only a single tooth. With a suitable proportion of parts, the single tooth of A only moves B one interval for a whole revolution of A; for it only gears with B by means of this single tooth. When that is not in gear, A simply slips past the teeth of B without moving the latter. All the other machinery of calculating engines leads up to and make use of this, or of some transformation of it, as its means of dealing with units of whatever decimal rank, instead of allowing indefinite fractions of units to appear in the result which must be printed from. This passage goes in-depth about the analytical engine, and how it can be used in a theoretical situation. The machine is shown to be programmable as it is able to receive input by an outside source. It also demonstrates an algorithm taking place, showcasing the ability to recognize different parts of the engine to represent different symbols, which all results in an output for the user. With that information, one can see the similarities between a modern-day computer and the analytical engine, both having an input, algorithm, and an output, with their biggest differences being the way these are programmed. From originating in the 19th century and the other in the 21st century, they are bound to have their differences. Another argument frequently brought up is that Ada Lovelace\u2019s contribution to the analytical engine is not considered as programming. This argument can be deemed false with the help of definitions and quotes from Note G of Sketch of The Analytical Engine Invented by Charles Babbage by Luigi Menabrea with notes by Ada Lovelace. The definition of a computer programmer falls under a 'skilled professional who codes, tests, debugs, and maintains the comprehensive instructions known as computer programs that devices should follow to execute their functions.' To sum things up, a computer programmer is responsible for creating the algorithm in which a user may input information to get the result of their input, in addition to the algorithm the computer possesses. Like previously stated, Note G of Sketch of The Analytical Engine Invented by Charles Babbage by Luigi Menabrea with notes by Ada Lovelace can completely debunk this argument. In this note, Ada broke down the function of the analytical engine to possibly calculate Bernoulli numbers. She demonstrates the process of how to manipulate the engine to receive the desired output. With the amount of contributions Ada Lovelace had with the analytical engine, there is no question that she influenced the world of computers, an influence displayed even to this day. Ada Lovelace is the first computer programmer in history, and because of that, she was able to create new algorithm concepts, and one that particularly stands out is the creation of an algorithm that utilizes loops. According to Thomas Haigh and Mark Priestley: Lovelace was particularly interested in 'cycles' of repeated operations, and the Bernoulli example involved two nested loops. In her Note E she reused 'some of the notation of the integral calculus' to express loops symbolically, including ones with bounds set by computed values rather than constants. This notation enabled her to write a one-line expression she described as 'representing the total operations for computing every Bernoulli number in succession.' This expression provides the missing control structure and, with cross-reference to the table, it could be used to generate the deck of operation cards needed to run the full calculation. In today\u2019s world, loops are seen in almost all coding languages, with every computer programmer utilizing loops regularly. Algorithms that utilize loops are extremely common, seen in advertisements, apps, and robots, proving that the concepts invented by Ada Lovelace are still being used and likely to continue for many years to come. With all of the displayed evidence, it is a very controversial topic with strong evidence on both sides. However, as the analytical engine is eligible to be considered a computer, and with all of her contributions\u2014mastering the analytical engine prior to the creator and creating concepts used in today\u2019s technology\u2014Ada is considered the first computer programmer for many with good judgment."

        "question": "Share your essay about heroes in computer science",
        "answer": "During the infamous World War Two, the Axis launched an assault on France, trampling all defenses with ease, forcing the Allies to retreat to the French port of Dunkirk. Surrounded by the arms of the Axis, the Allies were at risk of losing up to 350,000 soldiers, but when all hope was almost lost, \u201cOperation Dynamo\u201d was put into place, utilizing the help of the civilian boats. This heroic act from the civilians managed to successfully retreat the Allies back into England, and had the civilians not sacrificed themselves and their boats, the conclusion would have been detrimental. A classic tale of heroes saving the day, but most do not realize that these heroes come in all shapes and sizes. In today\u2019s day and age, thankfully, most won\u2019t have to worry about invasions from foreign countries taking their land, but with each day passing, one variable\u2019s capability and potential increases at an exponential rate. Technology, found in the majority\u2019s right pockets, plays a huge role in today\u2019s society. From communicating with a parent via phone calls to taking photos of black holes, the achievements of computer science are on par with none. There are multiple figures in the computer science world that can be deemed the title of a hero, but arguments arise when deciding whether these figures are needed for the future of computer science. Arguments that downplay the role of heroes in computer science can be deflated with historical evidence that proves heroes are representations of limits for future generations to surpass and can impact society not only ease of life but to be symbols of power against injustice and prejudice. In classic superhero comics such as Spider-Man, the main protagonist usually has a mentor who passes down his work and values and, in a way, is a representation of a limit for the protagonist to surpass. In Spider-Man\u2019s case, it was Uncle Ben giving Peter a life lesson and the iconic quote, 'With great power comes great responsibility.' A perfect representation of this in modern history is Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace. For some background, Charles Babbage, to many, accidentally created the world\u2019s first computer. Prior to the invention of the Analytical Engine, the \u201cworld\u2019s first computer,' he invented and partially created the machine called the Difference Engine. This engine was much simpler, only capable of mere addition, and after 12 years, Babbage invented a successor, naming it the Analytical Engine. This invention was able to do the four basic mathematical equations and store memory, an equivalent to today\u2019s term CPU. It was never officially constructed due to the magnitude of errors, but when Ada saw a publication of the analytical engine by Luigi Menabrea in 1942, she became inspired and decided to master it. In 1943, Ada published her own version of the paper, adding her concepts and ideas, and this publication, specifically Appendix G, demonstrated the possibility of calculating Bernoulli numbers. Unbeknownst to Ada and the world, it was the creation of the world\u2019s first computer program. Charles Babbage had created a legacy with the analytical engine, and it was Ada who took the already mighty machine to the next level. If an analogy is allowed, Charles Babbage is the Uncle Ben to Ada\u2019s Peter Parker. Charles\u2019 invention was a representation of a limit that Ada surpassed. This concept of heroes inspiring and motivating the next generation is a key factor in the growth of computer science, for if motivation is lackluster, there will be no reason to push for progress. In the age of 2022, there is no doubt that China has played a huge role in today's technology. Ranking number three in the world's technical expertise, China has displayed incredible achievements in the world of tech. From creating the world's first robot doctor to making an incredible social media app whose algorithm influences dopamine in users, there was once a time when China's culture was at risk of being erased. In the 1970s, typewriters revolutionized the west. Countries around the globe saw the importance of the typewriter and worked vigorously to, at a viewpoint, digitalize their language. At this point, China was aware of its use and the threat that it may cause their culture and language to render the Chinese language obsolete, but nothing of importance happened until the 1980s. With the language containing almost 70,000 characters, it was a difficult task to overcome. Nonetheless, the first typewriter for Chinese characters was created, but it was deemed highly inefficient. This was a sign of hope for a man named Wang Yongming. Inspired, he vowed to create a more efficient typewriter for the Chinese language to help lengthen the lifespan of their culture. In a process that had taken years, he deconstructed 70,000 Chinese characters into 125 components. These components worked similarly to atoms in chemistry, working as the essential building blocks to create any Chinese character. Wang called his invention the Wubi Method, and when displayed in the United Nations in 1984, the Wubi Method shocked the world. It was a complete success, and upon his return to China, he was deemed one of the most famous influential figures. He was, and still is, widely known as a Chinese hero who saved the Chinese language from extinction from the rise of technology. Although the Wubi Method would eventually become obsolete in comparison to Pinyin, it was Wang Yongming who ultimately saved the Chinese language from technology. The situation of Wang is a perfect example of why heroes are essential in the world of computer science. In this situation, the hero was needed to help society advance in the sense of ease of use. With the Wubi Method, China could adopt fast and efficient printing methods and compete with other countries, which ultimately saved their language and culture. Injustices have been a huge part of the history of mankind, but an injustice that still is a huge issue in today\u2019s world is racism. People in the millions have been discriminated against due to unimportant factors such as race, and sadly, computer science\u2019s history is no different. An example of this would be the US Census back in 1890. An African American man named Lewis H. Douglass protested the way the US Census graded people and their respective races. \u201cMulattoes, Quadroons, Octoroons,\u201d now deemed offensive, were the terms used to identify people of fractional colour. Lewis H. Douglass wrote a letter to the Supt. Porter regarded these terms as inefficient and unfitting of people of colour who were neither white nor black. The reply he received was not as shocking as Supt. Porter\u2019s letter primary point suggests, \u201cIf the class to which you refer is not covered by the above classifications, this office will be glad to have you indicate the classification necessary to be made to so cover it.\u201d Lewis H. Douglass replied with a potential solution to the inefficient and racist categorizing of the US Census, but Supt. Porter concluded with, 'I don\u2019t see any way out of it.' Although the protest was concluded unsuccessfully, Lewis H. Douglass stood up against the US Census and their derogatory ways. This act was not completely unsuccessful as in 1960, the US allowed the use of identifying their own race, and in 2000, it allowed users to identify with as many races as they deemed fit. Lewis H. Douglass is regarded as a hero to some in the world of computer science as he attempted to change the prejudice and injustice that the US census demonstrated. When observing figures that are deemed heroes, there is no doubt that they have impacted the world of computer science in a positive manner. In the tech race, there is no question that heroes are needed. From historical evidence, such as Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, heroes are shown to influence their era\u2019s respective programmers to surpass their achievements. With heroes present such as Wang Yongming, they are shown to be saviors of cultures, to not only advance them to the next era of technology but in cases like Lewis H. Douglass, fight against prejudice and injustices that might protrude. With all this historical evidence of heroes changing the path of computer science for the benefit, why wouldn\u2019t they be needed?"

        "answer": "I think the most effective aspect of Mehfraz\u2019s essay is the evidence used to support his main argument. Mehfraz added not only the opinion of the current society on the debated hero figures, but also the past\u2019s view on them as well. This was displayed during the paragraph surrounding Ada Lovelace. An importance to literture as it helps manipulate the reader into believing that Mehfraz\u2019s argument is the best one, a dire aspect to a strong essay."

        "question": "Share your opinions on Mehfraz's least effective aspect of his work.",
        "answer": "In my opinion, the weakest aspect of Mehfraz\u2019s essay is his introductory and conclusion. In the introduction, it starts off very strong, speaking about computer science as a whole, but then dramatically jumps into the subject of Ada Lovelace. Although it is fundamentally correct, I feel that a smooth transition would help improve the flow of the introduction. I suggest talking about how revolutionary the computer is in current society, then later connecting it to the first computer programmer. Another ineffective aspect is the thesis statement being lackluster and not giving a clear main arguement and the points that would support said argument. As a last piece of opinion, I felt that the conclusion was not a strong as it could have been, and that it was rather short. A suggestion is to take a part of each paragraph and add a short summary in the conclusion. Be wary to add the main points of your argument, so a seemless transition can be made at the very end. "

        "answer": "I think the most effective aspect of this work is Jir\u2019s ability to create an amazing introduction to the evidence that would eventually be used manipulate the reader to agree with Jir\u2019s argument, an increadilby important aspect to a strong essay. An example of an amazing introduction would be the body paragraph surrounding IBM. Jir spoke about Hollerith\u2019s tabulating machine that far surpassed any machine that said era had. Not only was the character of Hollerith greatly introduced, but it was a perfect introduction for IBM\u2019s roll in the essay."

        "answer": "I think the weakest aspect of this essay is the inability to manipulate the reader to agree with Jir\u2019s argument. Jir was successful in using strong evidences, but was not able to apply it into his argument. I felt that it leaves the reader with a cliff hanger rather than a formulated opinion. A suggestion is for Jir to go the extra mile and to explain how the evidence used had positivly impacted society. A situation where this suggestion could be implied is the first body paragraph regarding the difference machine and Charles Babbage. His main point in said body paragraph was that Babbage asked the british government for funding, and that the request was successfull. The paragraph, in a way, ends there. If Jir could explain why this supports his main argument, it could complete the paragraph, concluding a powerful point."

        "answer": "I think the most effective aspect of Junyong\u2019s work is the use of evidence. It seemed that Junyong\u2019s evidence was precicely planned out to fit and flow with each connecting evidence. The body paragrpah\u2019s flowed well with each other with no dramatic cuts. These evidences also strongly manipulate the readers to agree with Junyong\u2019s main argument, which is key to a powerful writing piece. This is extremely important to an essay as dramatic cuts prevent the reader from enjoying the literature and, in most cases, render it unclear."

        "answer": "The least effective aspect of Junyong\u2019s essay is, in my opinion, the lacklustre conclusion. In my eyes, a strong conclusion is a summary of all the body paragraph\u2019s points, which then aids the main argument, essential to the manipulation of readers to agree with any argument. In Junyong\u2019s case, it did not summarize any points made and just rather restated his thesis, giving the conclusion no profound meaning. I strongly recommend Junyong to add summaries of each body, as it will aid the reader see all of the points made, and formulate their own opinion."

        "question": "Share your essay on the banishment of trust in science.",
        "answer": "Imagine a metropolis of the future where self-driving cars traverse the roads, guided by cutting-edge AI systems aimed at transforming urban mobility, where a hidden bias in the AI's code gives preference to the well-being of luxury car occupants over passengers in more humble vehicles. On one rainy evening, an accident between a luxury and a humble car occurs, where the AI bias decides to prioritize the safety of the luxury car occupants, leaving the opposing occupants dead. Many would feel angered had an event happened in the real world, and to their surprise, we may already draw parallels to this imaginary scenario with today\u2019s technology, an example being how today\u2019s autonomous cars are more likely to hit dark-skinned individuals. As technology\u2019s role in society grows by the day, it\u2019s important that the inauspicious of technology is addressed. While many have attempted to create a process surrounding the status of opaque systems with respect to trust in science and failed, the three types of transparency by Kathleen A. Creel, in conjunction with the Value Free Ideal, may aid in identifying sources of bias in scientific algorithms, build public trust and improve the accuracy and reliability of scientific research. In Kathleen A. Creel\u2019s 2020 paper, 'Transparency in Complex Computational Systems', she discussed three main types of transparencies: functional transparency, structural transparency and run transparency. The unison of the Value Free Ideal, the theory that nurtures neutrality in scientific research, and functional transparency, the ability to understand how an algorithm functions, may create an environment that endorses the creation of algorithms that would be fair to all. Although transparency seems like the only logical path to follow, companies very often see this completely differently. In the world of business and tech, secrets are very often seen as a good thing. They keep the market different, giving the market variety as their secrets often gave them an advantage over their competitors. In a hypothetical world where all trade secrets were to go public, this would negatively affect all businesses as each would lose their past advantage. To combat this counterargument, this hypothetical world would inevitably push businesses to exchange ideas and encourage collaborations, which would result in bigger and better products. While functional transparency focuses on the algorithm that a system may use, structural transparency focuses on the structural design of a system and how the components work in conjunction with one another. Offering a comprehensive insight into the architecture of a system allows researchers and the public to examine and form their own opinions about a product. As technology becomes a bigger part of our everyday lives, the trust of the public grows as well, and if businesses and researchers adopt structural transparency, it would display their dedication to ethical accountability, resulting in a heightened public trust. To make something completely transparent takes time and effort, and in the eyes of the rich, if researchers spent all their time and effort on transparency, it would naturally halt the advancement of technology. Although a valid argument, many of the rich fail to realize that investing in transparency comes with a reputational boost that is beneficial not only to themselves but to the company as well. Another benefit of focusing on transparency is that it differentiates them from the opaqued market of systems nowadays, receiving a competitive edge. The final transparency, run transparency, focuses on the transparency of real-time monitoring and observation of an algorithm in a computer system. This would mean that while an algorithm is in progress, researchers, the public, and more may follow to help identify potential issues. Only by addressing said errors during the performance of an algorithm may researchers adjust and improve the algorithm and ensure that the result is accurate and reliable. Critics often say that emphasizing on-run transparency comes with the decline of other research aspects, such as designing new algorithms and analyzing past experiments, and significantly increases the chance of overfitting, where a model becomes too specific to certain data, reducing its generalization ability. Even with these strong arguments, critics fail to find that there is a balance between real-time monitoring and other research data. Their main argument frequently aligns with an exaggerated emphasis on run transparency, as if they lack the freedom of resource allocation. Although it may not be a good idea to fully emphasize run transparency, it would be beneficial to integrate it. In conclusion, combining the three transparency types proposed by Kathleen A. Creel and the Value-Free Ideal may present an effective solution to building trust in science and technology. Advocating for functional transparency helps researchers develop more fair algorithms for everyone, structural transparency to boost public trust by showing a commitment to ethics and openness and run transparency to improve accuracy and dependability in real-time. As we near a future that will prosper in science, it is important that measures are taken place to ensure ethical and unbiased systems are present in our society. By doing this, we may create a future where people can trust science as much as a bridge supports the cars that cross it."

        "question": "Share your paper about AI system classification and regulations",
        "answer": "In this paper, we react to objections to Minister Champagne's proposal to classify AI systems used for content prioritization and moderation as 'high impact.' This categorization is essential for handling ethical challenges and the societal impacts of such AI systems. We will show that such a categorization is necessary for accountability, fairness, and trust in AI development by examining the possibilities for bias, the need for regulatory standards, the accumulated consequences of unregulated systems, and the trade-offs of safety and innovation. Despite the perception of strict rules for platforms that organize information, it is crucial to emphasize the potential harm that AI can cause. AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is riddled with a well-documented issue regarding bias. This issue stems from creating models, as diverse datasets are used to train the model. These datasets are usually unfiltered, meaning all of society\u2019s good and evil are used. Despite the best efforts of developers, data containing ethical challenges such as bias, discrimination, stereotyping, and more can slip through data cleaning and be used during the training phases. These ethical challenges can then manifest in outputs, leading to biased AI. This concept extends to data-organizing AI in ways that many may not detect. For instance, a shopping website implements an AI model to tailor a user's featured page based on their data. After some time, the AI model recommends lower-range products to a particular demographic, opening the door to economic disparity. The lack of exposure to higher-quality products creates a cycle where only certain groups are targeted with lower-tier options, potentially preventing them from aspiring to access premium goods and highlighting the sense of injustice. Underestimating this scenario and the other potential damages that AI systems bring, regardless of their implementation, demonstrates ignorance as a failure to consider the negative impact on individuals and society. AI, such as data organization models, play a crucial role within applications by creating user experiences and perceptions, and by categorizing this group as 'high impact,' the industry recognizes that these systems significantly impact individuals and society. This categorization is essential for protecting the rights and well-being of people and promoting transparency, accountability, and fairness in AI development. While regulations regarding AI development help protect users from biased systems, many also question the disproportional burden smaller enterprises may face. For those who question this burden, we explore the arms race argument. Nick Bostrom suggests that if one is rushing to keep ahead of the competition, the entity will blatantly cut corners without time to design a safe system to achieve power. We expand on this using the following scenario where regulations regarding AI do not exist. In this world, enterprises work against each other to solely make their AI systems the best, oftentimes cutting corners in safety and ethics to receive a short-term boost against competitors. More significant enterprises such as META or Google would ultimately be forced to disregard any ethics and safety to keep their status quo in the industry, focusing more on creating the strongest model possible instead of creating a safe and ethical system. Smaller enterprises not driven by the goal of the status quo have more options. The first would focus entirely on benchmarks, like the more significant enterprises, potentially creating a flawed system. The second is willingly adhering to safety and ethics, risking being outpaced by competitors. Sadly, with how companies work, only the first option is feasible. If regulations like AIDA were implemented, incentives driving the arms race would be prevented by creating a common standard for all entities. Instead of a pressure-driven and unstable market, companies can focus on meeting standardized safety and ethical benchmarks, knowing that competitors must do the same. Applying frameworks like AIDA protects consumers and ensures enterprises of all levels, even the smallest ones, can prosper without resorting to hazardous shortcuts. While platforms with various algorithms for regulating content might have a lower chance of combining biases, the consequences are significant when considered collectively. To demonstrate, we begin with this. It is common knowledge that people rely on multiple applications that might utilize AI models for organizing data, like social media. A user may go into one application consuming one sort of bias and then to another to consume a different type of bias and repeat. While the bias may not be uniform between applications, users have more difficulty distinguishing between biases due to their non-uniform nature. This situation amplifies harm rather than mitigating it and extends to all ethical challenges. For example, one platform's push toward sensationalist misinformation can amplify another application's cultural biases. Instead of balancing each other out, different biases and ethical challenges can weaken the foundation of informed decision-making, leading to reduced trust and a more unstable society. With this comes another unravelling issue. Every enterprise that utilizes non-regulated data organization AI can create a valid argument against their contribution to bias and ethical challenges, creating a dynamic called the 'responsibility gap.' This gap makes it urgent to treat all these systems as 'high impact' because of their catastrophic collective outcome rather than their singular effect. No single platform can fully determine public sentiment or trust; however, multiple applications can change what users believe and how they engage with the world. Many argue that Minister Champagne's amendment would stifle the growth of innovation. However, many issues, such as the value alignment problem, demonstrate why prioritizing safety is not only required but also beneficial. The main overview of the value alignment problem is the importance of AI's objective matching the objectives of its users. Let us imagine a scenario where no regulations are placed upon AI in data organization, and values are not aligned correctly. These AI models would amplify stereotypes and spread misinformation, eventually leading to barriers to adoption, dampening investor enthusiasm, and creating a rush toward restrictive policies in a panic. The ignorance regarding safety precautions, such as the value alignment problem, creates a domino effect of problems, harming AI more than safety regulations such as AIDA. Now, let us imagine another scenario paralleling the first one; however, in this instance, AIDA considers data organization as 'high impact.' At first, the growth and innovation of data organization AI may halt as enterprises work to create models with ethics in mind. However, eventually, these enterprises deploy their AI models into the market. Due to the safety of these models, user happiness remains, giving developers the ability to create and innovate without the possibility of backlash or attracting firm investment. The push for safety does not stiffen innovation but protects it by earning a reputation and reliability that will encourage consumers and investors to embrace future advancements."

        "question": "Share your essay about sportsmanship",
        "answer": "According to Oxford Dictionary, the definition of sportsmanship is 'fair and generous behavior or treatment of others, especially in a sports contest.' To put it in similar terms, sportsmanship is the respect of holding the ball in the last seconds of a basketball match or shaking hands after each game. Giving respect where respect is asked and taking the sport seriously, alongside the players. Sportsmanship is important because it teaches people of all ages a lesson of respect and qualities that they can use later in life. It teaches to be respectful of their opponents on and off the court, which can build positive habits. Although important, sportsmanship is especially important in younger ages. Sportsmanship teaches young and developing kids to put differences aside to reach the same goal. It teaches them character, to act politely, respect, honor, discipline, kindness, inclusion, resilience, perseverance and much more. With younger kids displaying sportsmanship, it in a way hardwires them to be better people, setting them up for the future. In this assignment, I was asked to find three videos that demonstrated sportsmanship. Video one demonstrates two Olympic athletes competing for gold. They miraculously got the exact same score, and they had the option to undergo another round to see who the true winner was, but they both decided to get the gold medal together. This is a perfect example of sportsmanship, as each of them wanted complete fairness and did not want to alter the game rules by adding another round. They chose fairness and sacrificed some pride to do so, as some would critique it as not a complete win. In video two, it shows two athletes competing in tennis. While they were playing, opponent one served that was perceived to be out of bounds, but to everyone\u2019s surprise, opponent two challenged himself, giving opponent one his respective point. This video demonstrated sportsmanship in fairness, as opponent two had the option to be cheeky and take advantage of the situation to get the upper hand. But instead, he decided to be the better person and to play fair, challenging the referee's call which resulted in opponent one's point. Finally, in video three, it shows Steven Adams going up for a layup which, in my opinion, looked like it would have been an \u201cand one\u201d. But instead of that, he prioritized the safety of his opponent, giving up his easy layup and securing the unsteady opponent. Video three demonstrated a high sense of sportsmanship, as he demonstrated safety and respect towards his opponent. Steven Adams had the option to take the free layup and potentially the \u201cand one\u201d, but instead, he decided to save his opponent from a potential career-ending injury. All three of these videos are linked because they all demonstrated good sportsmanship. All three videos demonstrated fairness whether it would be splitting the gold reward in two or by challenging a call which is against you. These three videos are also linked because they all demonstrated fair play, courtesy, striving spirit, and grace in losing. For example, Steven Adams demonstrated grace in losing by deciding to choose between getting a point or saving someone from an injury. Another example would be that the tennis opponent demonstrated fair play by challenging a call that would have benefited him, concluding into a fair game. An athlete that I believe displays good sportsmanship in their everyday life is Manny Pacquiao. Manny Pacquiao is a world-famous boxer that comes from the Philippines, and to add, my mother's favorite athlete. He is described as humble, forgiving, and kind towards everyone including his opponents. Manny Pacquiao is so adored in fact, that he is in the running for president in the Philippines. It is very rare that Manny Pacquiao talks negatively against his opponents before the fight. Manny Pacquiao is a striving spirit; he always gives his all to become the best athlete that he can become. He also demonstrates grace in losing as he has lost, but he doesn't make excuses for his losses and takes accountability for his errors. As for why he is such a good person, we do not completely know. A hypothesis that I myself have is that as a result of his rather poor upbringing, he sees everything like luxury cars and luxury houses for what they are, luxury and materialistic. Something that one who had been brought up with money wouldn't be able to fully comprehend. With all said, I presume that Manny Pacquiao demonstrates good sportsmanship on and off the boxing ring because of how lucky he portrays himself as. He understands the struggle of being poor and not being able to have a meal every night, and he understands how lucky he is having all that he has. In conclusion, Manny Pacquiao is a world-famous boxer from the Philippines that is globally adored for his sportsmanship so much so that he is in the running for president in the Philippines. I believe that every athlete should study Manny Pacquiao\u2019s sportsmanship and learn a couple of things from him as he is a perfect example of someone who utilizes sportsmanship. In conclusion, sportsmanship is giving respect where respect is asked and taking the sport seriously alongside the players. Its importance teaches people of all ages a lesson of respect and qualities that they can use later in life. It teaches to be respectful of their opponents on and off the court, which can build positive habits. These habits correlate to almost all professional athletes, including Manny Pacquiao, a world-famous boxer from the Philippines that is globally adored for his sportsmanship, so much so that he is in the running for president in the Philippines."
