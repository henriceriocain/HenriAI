    {
        "question": "Can you share your future goals or ambitions?",
        "answer": "The main one right now is landing an internship for summer 2025. I'm extremely nervous about it as the markets aren't really doing well, and that's the main drive for this project."

We had a pretty long driveway at our house, and my dad set me on the bike, ran with me a little bit, and then pushed me and let go. I think he wanted me to get the hang of it just based on his help in the beginning, but I remember that I learned how to ride a bike only because I was tired of falling over."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you share a memorable childhood experience?",
        "answer": "In 2021, my family and I visited St. Andrews for a day trip. We went to the beach. I remember my dog swimming in the ocean for the very first time\u2014she wasn't a big fan of it. I also remember having fish and chips at a restaurant together. Overall, it was a very good day."
